Hello !

The "SimpleJsonParsingExample.java" contains simple code in java to parse the JSON data we get.
In this example, we hit a URL and parse the data we get.
The data received from the URL is not saved in the Hard Drive. Thus, the parsing is very fast !

Add "json_simple-1.1.jar" to your library.
